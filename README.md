#  Three-Tier Web Application with AWS

This project taught me how to set up a three-tier web application using AWS services by integrating the **presentation tier**, **logic tier**, and **data tier** to create a fully functional web application.  
My documentation of this entire project is [here](https://github.com/ShaimaBB/AWS-projects/blob/12a97505acb5fba18eaece7de760a4279bc8228c/AWS%20Three.pdf).

##  Overview

- Implement a three-tier architecture:
  1. **Presentation Tier**: Frontend display and distribution of the website.
  2. **Logic Tier**: Backend logic using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
  3. **Data Tier**: Database setup using DynamoDB.
- Connect the tiers for seamless data flow and user interaction.

##  Features

- **Amazon S3**: For storing and serving frontend files.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: For secure website distribution.
- **AWS Lambda**: For backend logic and handling API requests.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: For managing API endpoints.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For storing and querying user data.
